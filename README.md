## Multi-alphabet Text Recognition Using Deep Learning

This project leverages the power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to perform text recognition across multiple alphabets. Specifically, we utilize ViTSTR (Vision Transformer-based Scene Text Recognition: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08582) to train and recognize text in Latin, Arabic, and Korean alphabets. Full report of the project in croatian is found in the repository.
